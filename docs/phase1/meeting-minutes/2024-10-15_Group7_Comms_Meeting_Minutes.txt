### Meeting Minutes

Date: October 15, 2024 (12:30pm - 1pm)

Attendees: Joseph, Marcos, Roman, Salvador, Isaiah

Agenda:

1. Discuss changes to Client, User, and Message classes.

Discussion Points:

- Should User class contain list of already contacted users?
- How chatroom functionality is handled.
- Remove Admin class? Dual User constructors for both Admin and regular users.
- Server GUI? - Prospective
- Title of project changed to WeDiscuss.

Decisions Made:

- Within Message class, include Message Type - from int to enum (for readability) Ex: User message → User type, User message → Chatroom type.
- Chatroom contains list of Users to reference contacts for message deliveries.
- Remove Admin class and let Admin permissions be set by boolean flag within the User class.
- Add GUI classes; Baseline GUI for Users, trailing GUI for Admins.
- Message object is formatted for specific delivery; constructors specify destination and purpose within the system.
